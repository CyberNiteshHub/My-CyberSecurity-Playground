TryHackMe Lab Report – Become a Hacker 🧑‍💻🔥  
Author: Nitesh Verma (Cyber Nitesh)

- About this repository 📁  
This repository contains my learning record and completion proof for the TryHackMe room called "Become a Hacker". This lab is focused on offensive security basics and the hacker mindset. The main goal of this room is to understand how attackers think, how they find weaknesses, and how they exploit them in a legal and ethical way.

I have completed this room 100 percent and finished all tasks and exercises.

- Lab details ℹ️  
Room name: Become a Hacker  
Platform: TryHackMe  
Category: Offensive Security / Ethical Hacking Basics  
Status: Completed 100 percent ✅  

- What this lab is about 🧠  
In this room, I learned what offensive security means and how ethical hackers test systems to find weaknesses before real attackers do. The lab explains the basic terminology of hacking, how to find vulnerabilities, and how small weaknesses can be chained together to create a bigger impact.

- What I learned from this lab 📘  
I learned what offensive security and ethical hacking really mean  
I learned how to think like an attacker and ask questions about how things can break  
I learned how to find weaknesses in a web application  
I learned how to use directory brute forcing to find hidden pages  
I learned how a hidden login page can become a serious issue  
I learned how weak passwords can be exploited using a dictionary attack  
I learned how multiple small weaknesses can be chained together  
I learned the basics of exploitation in a safe and legal environment  

- Practical work done in this lab 🛠️  
First, I learned the basic concepts of offensive security and the hacker mindset. After that, I moved to finding weaknesses in a target web application. I used enumeration techniques to discover a hidden login page on the website.

The hidden page I discovered was:  
/login  

The status code returned when accessing this page was:  
200  

After finding the login page, I moved to the exploitation part. I used a dictionary attack to try different passwords for the admin user. This helped me understand how weak passwords can be broken using automated tools.

The password I discovered for the admin user was:  
qwerty  

After logging in successfully, the secret message displayed on the page was:  
THM{born_to_hack!}  

Before finding the correct password, the number of failed attempts was:  
17  

- Important concepts covered 🔐  
Offensive Security  
Ethical Hacking  
Red Team  
Penetration Testing  
Vulnerability  
Exploit  
Enumeration  
Credentials  
Authentication  
Dictionary Attack  
Chaining Weaknesses  

- Hacker mindset 🧩  
This lab taught me that hacking is not just about tools, but about thinking differently. A hacker looks at a system and asks what can go wrong, what can be misused, and how different weaknesses can be combined. Ethical hackers use this same mindset to make systems more secure.

- Completion status ✅  
All tasks completed  
All exercises finished  
All questions answered correctly  
Room marked as completed on TryHackMe  

- What I will do next 🚀  
After this room, I plan to continue with more offensive security and ethical hacking labs on TryHackMe, and also build a strong foundation in both Red Team and Blue Team skills.
