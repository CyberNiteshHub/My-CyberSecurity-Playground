TryHackMe Lab Report – Become a Defender 🛡️  
Author: Nitesh Verma (Cyber Nitesh)

- About this repository 📁  
This repository contains my learning record and completion proof for the TryHackMe room called "Become a Defender". This lab is focused on defensive security and Blue Team fundamentals. The purpose of this room is to understand how defenders think, how they understand an environment, and how they protect systems from real-world attacks.

I have completed this room 100 percent and finished all tasks and exercises.

- Lab details ℹ️  
Room name: Become a Defender  
Platform: TryHackMe  
Category: Defensive Security / Blue Team  
Status: Completed 100 percent ✅  

- What this lab teaches 🧠  
In this room, I learned what defensive security really means and why it is important. I learned how defenders look at systems, networks, users, and servers as one complete environment instead of separate parts. The lab also explains how to think like a defender and how to reduce risk by applying proper security controls.

- What I learned from this lab 📘  
I learned the basics of defensive security and the Blue Team mindset  
I learned how to understand and map an environment before protecting it  
I learned why visibility is important, like logs, alerts, and monitoring  
I learned the difference between prevention, detection, and mitigation  
I learned how to think in terms of risk and how to prioritize critical systems  
I learned how attackers move step by step and how defenders can stop them  

- Practical work done in this lab 🛠️  
First exercise was about understanding the environment. In this part, a city was used as an example of a client’s infrastructure. I mapped different parts of the city to real systems like servers, users, networks, and the internet. This helped me understand what needs to be protected and where everything fits in the environment.

After completing this exercise, I received this flag:  
THM{mapping_infrastructure!}

Second exercise was about defending the environment. In this part, I applied security controls to different parts of the city based on the risks. This taught me how defenders protect important systems and how risk prioritization works in real life.

After completing this exercise, I received this flag:

- Important concepts covered 🔐  
Defensive Security  
Blue Team  
CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)  
Visibility and Monitoring  
Prevention, Detection, Mitigation  
Risk and Risk Prioritization  
Threat Analysis  
Incident Analysis  
Infrastructure Mapping  
Security Controls  

- Defender mindset 🧩  
This lab taught me that defense is not a one-time setup. Defenders must always think about how an attacker can move inside a system. They must continuously improve security, monitor systems, and adapt to new threats. Protecting systems means understanding both how systems work and how attackers think.

- Completion status ✅  
All tasks completed  
All exercises finished  
All flags captured  
Room marked as completed on TryHackMe  

- What I will do next 🚀  
After this room, I plan to continue with more defensive security and Blue Team related paths on TryHackMe like Cyber Security 101, SOC Level 1, and later also improve my offensive skills with penetration testing labs.
